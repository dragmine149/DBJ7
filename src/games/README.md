# Documentation for making a new game

Making a new game, for someone to bet currency on is pretty easy, some required functions and the rest is up to you.

NOTE: all commands listed in this file support both normal and slash commands

## Setting up the file

The file requires some functions and classes to work, after that everything is left up to you.

```py
# Minimum requirements
from discord.ext import commands
import discord

class gameTest:
    """
    Breif description of the game, will show in the dropdown.
    """
    def __init__(self, bot: commands.bot) -> None:
        # Default function, Setup and imports the rest of the bot
        self.bot = bot
        pass
    
    # This function is not required, but shows an emoji on the dropdown
    @property
    def display_emoji(self) -> str:
        return "ðŸ§ª"
    
    # This is a required function, gets called once the bot is selected. Lets the bot do stuff
    def start(self, Interaction: discord.Interaction):
        pass

# Links this game with the rest of the bot
def game_setup(bot):
    return gameTest(bot)
```

The location of the file should be in `/src/games` (where this readme file is)

### Optional (But recommened) requirements

There are also other things that can be added to make the UX better, these are listed below.

```py
# Money selector ui
from src.utils.MoneySelector import MoneySelector

def moneyCallback(Interaction: discord.Interaction, value: int):
    print(f"Retrieved {int}")

main = MoneySelector(interaction, moneyCallback)
main.get_money()
```

## Testing the file

Due to the nature of how these files are loaded, there is no need to restart the bot after each load, just run the command `{prefix}reloadgames`.

This will reload all games currently loaded in,. No new games will be loaded though, that will need a bot restart. (Change?)

To test a game, run command `{prefix}playgame` and select the game that you would like to test from the dropdown option that appears.

## Error handling

These games have some default error handlering by default, but some will just completly break (Easier to let them raise an error as that iis more noticable than loggin an error).

### Error situtations (What errors and how to fix)

#### Exception 1: Failed to start game (Breaks)

Cause: a file in `/src/games` does not have the `start` function under the class.

Fix: create function `start` with paramaters `(self, Interaction)`

#### Exception 2: No description provided (Doesn't break)

View: Shows in the dropdown

Cause: A __doc__ method wasn't found in the class

Fix: add a __doc__ menu in the class (example above)

#### Exception 3: No Emoji Provided (Doesn't break)

View: Blank image in the dropdown menu

Cause: A `display_emoji` property wasn't found in the class

Fix: add a `display_emoji` property in the class (example above)

#### Other Errors

Cause: Probably something that you did, which the module couldn't load probably

Fix: Make sure you have the required above, if you do make sure that the module isn't broken itself (normally a bot restart can help you find the error better)

## Talking with the accountment system

To Be Added, Waiting on more functions to be added.

## Example files

If you ever need examples, check the other files in this folder (`/src/games`).
